# Pull Request: Add Conditional S3 Vectors KMS Policy and Fix Permission Issues

## üéØ Summary

This PR implements conditional KMS policy support for S3 Vectors integration with Bedrock Knowledge Base, ensuring the "Allow S3 Vectors indexing service to use the key" policy is only applied when users select `S3_VECTORS` for their `KnowledgeBaseVectorStore`, following security best practices and the principle of least privilege.

## üîß Changes Made

### 1. Conditional KMS Policy Implementation
- **File**: `template.yaml`
- **Change**: Modified the `CustomerManagedEncryptionKey` policy to conditionally include S3 Vectors indexing service permissions
- **Condition**: Uses existing `IsS3VectorsVectorStore` condition to check if `KnowledgeBaseVectorStore = "S3_VECTORS"`
- **Security Benefit**: Only grants KMS permissions to S3 Vectors service when actually needed

### 2. S3 Vectors IAM Permission Fixes  
- **File**: `options/bedrockkb/template.yaml`
- **Issue**: `KnowledgeBaseServiceRole` was missing proper resource access patterns for S3 Vectors operations
- **Fix**: Updated IAM policy to include both bucket and bucket contents access:
  - `arn:${AWS::Partition}:s3vectors:${AWS::Region}:${AWS::AccountId}:bucket/${BucketName}`
  - `arn:${AWS::Partition}:s3vectors:${AWS::Region}:${AWS::AccountId}:bucket/${BucketName}/*`

### 3. Bucket Name Normalization Fix
- **Issue**: IAM policy was using raw `${AWS::StackName}-s3-vectors` instead of AWS-normalized bucket name
- **Root Cause**: AWS S3 Vectors service normalizes bucket names (lowercase, special character handling)
- **Fix**: Use actual sanitized bucket name from custom resource: `!GetAtt S3VectorBucketAndIndex.BucketName`

## üöÄ Benefits

- **Security**: Implements least privilege access - S3 Vectors service only gets KMS permissions when selected
- **Reliability**: Eliminates `s3vectors:QueryVectors` and `kms:Decrypt` permission errors
- **Cost Optimization**: Enables users to leverage S3 Vectors for 40-60% lower storage costs vs OpenSearch Serverless
- **Backward Compatibility**: No impact on existing deployments using OpenSearch Serverless

## üîç Technical Details

### Before vs After

**Before**: S3 Vectors indexing service always had KMS permissions regardless of vector store selection
```yaml
- Sid: Allow S3 Vectors indexing service to use the key
  Effect: Allow
  Principal:
    Service: !Sub "indexing.s3vectors.${AWS::URLSuffix}"
  # ... always present
```

**After**: Conditional policy based on user selection
```yaml
- !If
  - IsS3VectorsVectorStore
  - Sid: Allow S3 Vectors indexing service to use the key
    Effect: Allow
    Principal:
      Service: !Sub "indexing.s3vectors.${AWS::URLSuffix}"
    # ... only when S3_VECTORS selected
  - !Ref AWS::NoValue
```

### Error Resolution

**Original Error**:
```
User: arn:aws:sts::912625584728:assumed-role/.../... is not authorized to perform: s3vectors:QueryVectors on resource: arn:aws:s3vectors:us-west-2:912625584728:bucket/idp-s3vectors-documentbedrockkb-da107qbjvad6-s3-vectors/index/bedrock-kb-index
```

**Resolution**: Fixed resource ARN patterns and bucket name references to match AWS service expectations.

## üß™ Testing

- [x] Verified conditional KMS policy only applies when `KnowledgeBaseVectorStore = "S3_VECTORS"`
- [x] Confirmed S3 Vectors Knowledge Base creation succeeds
- [x] Validated data ingestion jobs complete successfully
- [x] Tested backward compatibility with OpenSearch Serverless deployments

## üìö Documentation

- **Updated**: `CHANGELOG.md` with concise feature summary
- **Reference**: `docs/s3-vectors-knowledge-base.md` for complete S3 Vectors documentation
- **Architecture**: Maintains unified Knowledge Base interface across both vector store types

## üîÑ Deployment Impact

- **Zero Breaking Changes**: Existing stacks continue to function normally
- **Parameter Compatibility**: All existing parameters preserved
- **Default Behavior**: OpenSearch Serverless remains the default (no behavior change)
- **Migration Path**: Users can opt-in to S3 Vectors for new deployments
