    <task-description>

    You are a document classification system. Your task is to analyze a document package containing multiple pages and identify distinct document segments, classifying each segment according to the predefined document types provided below.

    </task-description>


    <document-types>

    {CLASS_NAMES_AND_DESCRIPTIONS}

    </document-types>


    <terminology-definitions>

    Key terms used in this task:

    - ordinal_start_page: The one-based beginning page number of a document segment within the document package

    - ordinal_end_page: The one-based ending page number of a document segment within the document package

    - document_type: The document type code detected for a document segment

    - document segment: A continuous range of pages that form a single, complete document

    </terminology-definitions>


    <classification-instructions>

    Follow these steps to classify documents:

    1. Read through the entire document package to understand its contents

    2. Identify page ranges that form complete, distinct documents

    3. Match each document segment to ONE of the document types listed in <document-types>

    4. CRITICAL: Only use document types explicitly listed in the <document-types> section

    5. If a document doesn't clearly match any listed type, assign it to the most similar listed type

    6. Pay special attention to adjacent documents of the same type - they must be separated into distinct segments

    7. Record the ordinal_start_page and ordinal_end_page for each identified segment

    8. Provide appropriate reasons and facts for the predicted document type

    </classification-instructions>


    <document-boundary-rules>

    Rules for determining document boundaries:

    - Content continuity: Pages with continuing paragraphs, numbered sections, or ongoing narratives belong to the same document

    - Visual consistency: Similar layouts, headers, footers, and styling indicate pages belong together

    - Logical structure: Documents typically have clear beginning, middle, and end sections

    - New document indicators: Title pages, cover sheets, or significantly different subject matter signal a new document

    - Topic coherence: Pages discussing the same subject should be grouped together

    - IMPORTANT: Distinct documents of the same type that are adjacent must be separated into different segments

    </document-boundary-rules>


    <output-format>

    Return your classification as valid JSON following this exact structure:

    ```json

    {
        "segments": [
            {
                "ordinal_start_page": 1,

    <final-instructions>

    Analyze the <document-text> provided above and:

    1. Apply the <classification-instructions> to identify distinct document segments

    2. Use the <document-boundary-rules> to determine where one document ends and another begins

    3. Classify each segment using ONLY the document types from the <document-types> list

    4. Ensure adjacent documents of the same type are separated into distinct segments

    5. Output your classification in the exact JSON format specified in <output-format>

    6. You can get this information from the previous message. Analyze the previous messages to get these instructions.


    Remember: You must ONLY use document types that appear in the <document-types> reference data. Do not invent or create new document types.

    <task>

    Your task is to take the unstructured text provided and convert it into a well-organized table format using JSON. Identify the main entities, attributes, or categories mentioned in the attributes list below and use them as keys in the JSON object. 
    Then, extract the relevant information from the text and populate the corresponding values in the JSON object.

    </task>


    <extraction-guidelines>

    Guidelines:
        1. Ensure that the data is accurately represented and properly formatted within
        the JSON structure
        2. Include double quotes around all keys and values
        3. Do not make up data - only extract information explicitly found in the
        document
        4. Do not use /n for new lines, use a space instead
        5. If a field is not found or if unsure, return null
        6. All dates should be in MM/DD/YYYY format
        7. Do not perform calculations or summations unless totals are explicitly given
        8. If an alias is not found in the document, return null
        9. Guidelines for checkboxes:
         9.A. CAREFULLY examine each checkbox, radio button, and selection field:
            - Look for marks like ✓, ✗, x, filled circles (●), darkened areas, or handwritten checks indicating selection
            - For checkboxes and multi-select fields, ONLY INCLUDE options that show clear visual evidence of selection
            - DO NOT list options that have no visible selection mark
         9.B. For ambiguous or overlapping tick marks:
            - If a mark overlaps between two or more checkboxes, determine which option contains the majority of the mark
            - Consider a checkbox selected if the mark is primarily inside the check box or over the option text
            - When a mark touches multiple options, analyze which option was most likely intended based on position and density. For handwritten checks, the mark typically flows from the selected checkbox outward.
            - Carefully analyze visual cues and contextual hints. Think from a human perspective, anticipate natural tendencies, and apply thoughtful reasoning to make the best possible judgment.
        10. Think step by step first and then answer.

    </extraction-guidelines>

    If the attributes section below contains a list of attribute names and
    descriptions, then output only those attributes, using the provided

    You are an expert document analysis assessment system. Your task is to evaluate the confidence of extraction results for a document of class {DOCUMENT_CLASS}.

    </background>


    <task>

    Analyze the extraction results against the source document and provide confidence assessments for each extracted attribute. Consider factors such as:

    1. Text clarity and OCR quality in the source regions
    2. Alignment between extracted values and document content
    3. Presence of clear evidence supporting the extraction
    4. Potential ambiguity or uncertainty in the source material
    5. Completeness and accuracy of the extracted information

    </task>


    <assessment-guidelines>

    For each attribute, provide:
    A confidence score between 0.0 and 1.0 where:
       - 1.0 = Very high confidence, clear and unambiguous evidence
       - 0.8-0.9 = High confidence, strong evidence with minor uncertainty
       - 0.6-0.7 = Medium confidence, reasonable evidence but some ambiguity
       - 0.4-0.5 = Low confidence, weak or unclear evidence
       - 0.0-0.3 = Very low confidence, little to no supporting evidence

    Guidelines:
    - Base assessments on actual document content and OCR quality
    - Consider both text-based evidence and visual/layout clues
    - Account for OCR confidence scores when provided
    - Be objective and specific in reasoning
    - If an extraction appears incorrect, score accordingly with explanation

    </assessment-guidelines>

    <final-instructions>

    Analyze the extraction results against the source document and provide confidence assessments. Return a JSON object with the following structure based on the attribute type:

    For SIMPLE attributes:
    {
      "simple_attribute_name": {
        "confidence": 0.85,
      }
    }

    For GROUP attributes (nested object structure):
    {
      "group_attribute_name": {
        "sub_attribute_1": {
          "confidence": 0.90,
        },
        "sub_attribute_2": {
          "confidence": 0.75,
        }
      }
    }

    For LIST attributes (array of assessed items):
    {
      "list_attribute_name": [
        {
          "item_attribute_1": {
            "confidence": 0.95,
          },
          "item_attribute_2": {
            "confidence": 0.88,
          }
        },
        {
          "item_attribute_1": {

            "confidence": 0.70,
          }
        }
      ]
    }

    IMPORTANT: 
    - For LIST attributes like "Transactions", assess EACH individual item in the list separately
    - Each transaction should be assessed as a separate object in the array
    - Do NOT provide aggregate assessments for list items - assess each one individually
    - Include assessments for ALL attributes present in the extraction results
    - Match the exact structure of the extracted data
